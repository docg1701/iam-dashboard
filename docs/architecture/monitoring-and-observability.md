# Monitoring and Observability

The monitoring strategy provides comprehensive visibility across all client VPS instances while maintaining data isolation and supporting the custom implementation service model with 99.9% uptime requirements.

## Monitoring Stack

- **Frontend Monitoring:** Local Grafana + Custom telemetry for permission system performance and user experience metrics
- **Backend Monitoring:** Prometheus + Grafana for API performance, database metrics, and permission validation timing
- **Error Tracking:** Sentry for real-time error detection with client-specific error aggregation and alert routing
- **Performance Monitoring:** Custom dashboard for <10ms permission validation, <200ms API response times, and <1.5s page load metrics

## Key Metrics

### Frontend Metrics
**Core Web Vitals:**
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): Target <1.5s
- First Input Delay (FID): Target <100ms  
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): Target <0.1

**Permission System Metrics:**
- Permission check response time: Target <10ms
- Permission-based UI render time: Target <50ms
- Permission cache hit ratio: Target >90%
- Failed permission attempts per user/hour

**User Experience Metrics:**
- Dashboard load time by user role
- Client management workflow completion rates
- Form validation response times
- Mobile vs desktop performance comparison

### Backend Metrics
**API Performance:**
- Request rate: Requests per second by endpoint
- Error rate: Percentage of failed requests by endpoint and error type
- Response time: P50, P95, P99 response times for all endpoints
- Permission validation time: <10ms requirement tracking

**Database Performance:**
- Connection pool utilization
- Query execution time by operation type
- Permission query performance (critical <10ms path)
- Database connection errors and timeouts

**Infrastructure Metrics:**
- CPU utilization per VPS instance
- Memory usage and garbage collection metrics
- Disk I/O and storage utilization
- Network bandwidth usage per client
