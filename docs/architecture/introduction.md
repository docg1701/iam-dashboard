# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **Multi-Agent IAM Dashboard**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

The Multi-Agent IAM Dashboard is a **Custom Implementation Service** delivering fully-customized multi-agent AI automation infrastructure on dedicated VPS instances within 30 days. Each implementation provides complete visual branding customization, dedicated infrastructure, and flexible agent-based permission systems that enable 90% of employees to access needed functionality while maintaining security boundaries.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on the comprehensive PRD analysis, this is a **greenfield project** with no existing starter templates. The architecture is purpose-built for the custom implementation service model, leveraging:

- **Next.js 15 + React 19** for modern frontend development
- **FastAPI + SQLModel** for high-performance backend services
- **PostgreSQL with pgvector** for structured data and future AI capabilities
- **Custom permission system** as the core architectural innovation
- **Multi-agent communication patterns** through shared database access

The decision to build from scratch ensures complete optimization for the revolutionary agent-based permission system and Brazilian market requirements.
