## Technical Integration Notes

### Permission System Architecture

The permission system represents the **core innovation** of this platform, transforming traditional role-based access into flexible agent-based permissions:

```typescript
// Permission-aware component example
<PermissionGuard agent="client_management" operation="create">
  <Button onClick={createClient}>Novo Cliente</Button>
</PermissionGuard>
```

**Detailed Implementation**: [Permission Integration Guide](./architecture/permission-integration-guide.md)

### Multi-Agent Communication Patterns

Agents communicate through shared database access with strict boundaries:

- **Read-Only Cross-Agent Access**: Agents can read from other agents' tables
- **Own-Table Modifications**: Agents only modify their own tables
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: WebSocket updates for live data changes

**Technical Details**: [Frontend Architecture](./architecture/frontend-architecture.md#multi-agent-integration)

### Performance Optimization
