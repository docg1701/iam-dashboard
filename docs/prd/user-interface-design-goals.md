# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The interface should deliver a professional, enterprise-grade experience that reflects each client's brand identity while maintaining exceptional usability. The design must convey trustworthiness and sophistication, as clients will present this platform to their own customers. The user experience should feel custom-built rather than generic, with intuitive workflows that enhance productivity while eliminating friction in daily client management tasks.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Dashboard-Centric Navigation:** Primary workspace centered around a comprehensive dashboard showing key metrics, recent activities, and quick access to core functions
- **Context-Aware Actions:** Interface adapts based on user role (sysadmin, admin, user) and current workflow state
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Complex functionality revealed gradually to avoid overwhelming users while keeping advanced features accessible
- **Immediate Feedback:** Real-time validation, confirmation messages, and progress indicators for all user actions
- **Responsive Touch-First:** Optimized for both desktop efficiency and mobile/tablet touch interactions

## Core Screens and Views

From a product perspective, the most critical screens necessary to deliver the PRD values and goals:

- **Authentication Screen** - Login with 2FA integration reflecting client branding  
- **Main Dashboard** - Overview of client statistics, recent activities, and system health
- **Client Management View** - CRUD interface for client data with advanced search and filtering
- **Client Detail Page** - Comprehensive view of individual client information with edit capabilities
- **User Administration Panel** - Account management interface for sysadmins
- **Data Import/Export Interface** - CSV import functionality and bulk operations
- **System Settings Page** - Configuration management and branding customization
- **Audit Trail View** - Comprehensive logging interface for compliance and troubleshooting

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The platform must meet WCAG AA standards to ensure accessibility for users with diverse abilities, supporting screen readers, keyboard navigation, and color contrast requirements for professional business environments.

## Branding

Complete visual identity integration is critical to the value proposition. Each implementation must seamlessly incorporate:
- Client logos and brand assets throughout the interface
- Custom color schemes matching brand guidelines  
- Typography selection from pre-approved professional font families
- UI elements styled to reflect client's visual identity
- Consistent brand application across all screens and components
- Real-time branding preview and deployment capabilities

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

The platform targets modern web browsers with complete responsive design supporting:
- **Desktop:** Primary workflow interface optimized for productivity
- **Tablet:** Touch-optimized interface maintaining full functionality  
- **Mobile:** Essential functions accessible with mobile-first responsive design
- **Cross-browser compatibility:** ES2020+ standards across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
