# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

"Please review the enhanced Multi-Agent IAM Dashboard PRD (docs/prd.md) and create detailed UX/UI specifications focusing on the permission-aware user interfaces, custom branding system, and responsive design implementation. Pay special attention to the permission-based navigation, user role management interfaces, and permission configuration dialogs. Ensure the professional enterprise experience requirements and WCAG AA accessibility compliance are maintained across all permission-aware components."

## Architect Prompt  

"Please review the enhanced Multi-Agent IAM Dashboard PRD (docs/prd.md) and design the technical architecture for this custom implementation service with integrated agent permission system. Focus on the monolith + independent agents pattern with permission validation middleware, permission database schema with user_agent_permissions table, custom branding CSS variable system, and SSH-based VPS deployment and configuration. Address the technical implementation of permission checking with Redis caching, agent permission inheritance, and scalable permission validation across all agents."

## Development Team Handoff

"The PRD has been updated to reflect the enhanced user permission system addressing the critical usability issues identified during Epic 1 planning. Epic 1 has been expanded with Stories 1.6-1.9 implementing agent-based permissions per [FR16-FR18 requirements](./prd/requirements.md#fr16-enhanced-user-roles-with-agent-permissions). The system now supports flexible user access control while maintaining security boundaries, transforming the platform from a restrictive administrative tool into a practical operational system for all user types. Development should begin with Story 1.6 (Enhanced User Roles with Agent Permissions) as the foundation for all subsequent features."
