4. **Database Relationships:** Proper foreign key relationships and constraints between all entities
5. **Migration Scripts:** Alembic migrations for all initial schemas with proper indexing
6. **Validation:** Comprehensive field validation including CPF format validation using cnpj-cpf-validator and uniqueness constraints
7. **Test Data:** Factory patterns and seed data for development and testing environments

## Dev Notes

### Technical Context from Architecture Documents

**Database Schema Requirements:**
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#database-schema-postgresql-ddl]
- PostgreSQL with UUID primary keys using uuid-ossp extension
- User roles enumeration: 'sysadmin', 'admin', 'user'
- Agent names enumeration: 'client_management', 'pdf_processing', 'reports_analysis', 'audio_recording'
- Audit action enumeration: 'create', 'read', 'update', 'delete', 'login', 'logout', 'permission_change'
- Performance indexes for <10ms permission checking: user_id + agent_name composite index
- JSONB fields for flexible audit trail storage with old_values and new_values

**Data Models Specifications:**
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#user-model]
- User Model: UUID id, EmailStr email, bcrypt password_hash, UserRole enum, TOTP secret optional
- Client Model: UUID id, name (2-100 chars), CPF CHAR(11) unique, date birth_date, created_by UUID FK
- UserAgentPermission Model: UUID id, user_id FK, agent_name enum, CRUD permissions as booleans
- AuditLog Model: UUID id, actor_id FK, action enum, resource tracking with JSONB values

**Project Structure Guidelines:**
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#application-packages]
- Backend models location: `apps/api/src/models/` with separate files per model
- Migration location: `apps/api/alembic/` for database version control
- Test factories: `apps/api/tests/factories/` for test data generation
- Model tests: `apps/api/tests/test_models/` for unit testing

**Technology Stack Requirements:**
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- FastAPI >=0.116.1 with SQLModel for database ORM
- PostgreSQL >=17.5 with Alembic >=1.16.4 for migrations
- Pydantic >=2.11.7 for data validation and settings
- cnpj-cpf-validator >=0.1.2 for Brazilian document validation
- pytest >=8.4.1 + pytest-asyncio >=1.1.0 for testing framework

**Backend Architecture Context:**
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#service-architecture]
- Models organized by domain: user.py, client.py, permission.py, audit.py
- SQLModel integration with FastAPI for automatic API documentation
- Database session management through dependency injection
- Business logic separation in services layer with models as data layer

**Coding Standards Requirements:**
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- Database transactions required for multi-table operations with proper rollback
- All state-changing operations must include audit trail within same transaction
- Input validation with Pydantic schemas before processing to prevent injection
- Type sharing via packages/shared to prevent API/frontend type mismatches
- CPF validation must use shared cnpj-cpf-validator utility for consistency

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#critical-testing-directives-compliance]
- NEVER mock internal business logic: PermissionService logic, authentication flows, database operations (in integration)
- ALWAYS mock external boundaries: HTTP calls, SMTP servers, file I/O, third-party libraries, time/UUID generation
- Test file location: `apps/api/tests/test_models/` for model unit tests
- Factory patterns: `apps/api/tests/factories/` for realistic test data generation
- Integration tests: Test actual database operations without mocking internal models
- Coverage requirement: Comprehensive coverage for all model validation and constraint scenarios

**Testing Framework Configuration:**
- pytest with async support for database testing
- Factory patterns for realistic test data generation
- Database transaction rollback for test isolation
- Comprehensive validation testing including edge cases
- Model relationship and constraint testing

### Project Structure Notes
All model files align with backend architecture specifications. Database migration files follow Alembic conventions in `apps/api/alembic/versions/`. Test organization matches testing strategy requirements with factories and model tests properly separated.
