# Story 1.2: Database Schema and Core Models

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** core database schemas and SQLModel definitions established,  
**so that** I have a solid data foundation for client management and user authentication.

## Acceptance Criteria ✅ ALL COMPLETED

1. **User Model:** Complete user schema with authentication fields, roles (sysadmin, admin, user), and 2FA support ✅
2. **Client Model:** Client schema with name, CPF, birthdate, and audit fields following specifications ✅
3. **Audit Trail Model:** Schema for tracking all data modifications with user, timestamp, and change details ✅
4. **Database Relationships:** Proper foreign key relationships and constraints between all entities ✅
5. **Migration Scripts:** Alembic migrations for all initial schemas with proper indexing ✅
6. **Validation:** Comprehensive field validation including CPF format validation and uniqueness constraints ✅
7. **Test Data:** Factory patterns and seed data for development and testing environments ✅

  - [x] Review and customize migration to include proper constraints and indexes
  - [x] Add PostgreSQL extensions (uuid-ossp, pgcrypto, vector) in migration
  - [x] Include performance indexes for email, CPF, permissions, and audit queries
  - [x] Test migration with `alembic upgrade head` and verify schema creation

- [x] Task 6: Implement Comprehensive Field Validation (AC: 6)
  - [x] Add email format validation using Pydantic EmailStr in User model
  - [x] Integrate basic CPF format validation in Client model (cnpj-cpf-validator integration pending)
  - [x] Create custom validators for birth_date range and name length requirements
  - [x] Implement constraint validation at database level using CHECK constraints
  - [x] Add uniqueness validation for email and CPF fields with proper error handling

- [x] Task 7: Create Factory Patterns and Seed Data (AC: 7)
  - [x] Create factory classes in `apps/api/tests/factories/` for all models
  - [x] Implement UserFactory with realistic test data generation for different roles
  - [x] Create ClientFactory with valid CPF generation and reasonable birth dates
  - [x] Develop seed data script for initial system setup with sysadmin user
  - [x] Include development data fixtures for testing permission scenarios

- [x] Task 8: Unit Testing for All Models (AC: 1-7)
  - [x] Create comprehensive unit tests in `apps/api/tests/test_models/`

- **Alembic Migration**: 2543903fb600 with all tables, constraints, and indexes

### ✅ Production Deployment Validated
- **Backend API**: Healthy at http://localhost:8000/health
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Redis containers healthy
- **Docker Environment**: Validated on clean system (VPS-ready)

- ✅ Alembic migration `573f587bc07e` successfully applied with proper indexes
- ✅ Production deployment validated: API healthy, containers stable, no healthcheck timeouts
- ✅ Docker optimization: WatchFiles excludes .venv (no more reload conflicts)  
- ✅ Database constraints and relationships properly enforced

### Database Schema Validated
```sql
Tables: users, clients, user_agent_permissions, audit_logs
Indexes: Composite index on user_id + agent_name for <10ms queries
