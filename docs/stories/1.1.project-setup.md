- **Evidence**: No more permission errors in logs

**Issue 2: Missing Dependencies** ✅ FIXED  
- **Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'asyncpg'`
- **Root Cause**: FastAPI using asyncpg driver but not installed
- **Solution**: `uv add asyncpg` (following CLAUDE.md rules)
- **Evidence**: Database connections working

**Issue 3: Python Syntax Error** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: `SyntaxError: import * only allowed at module level`
- **Root Cause**: Dynamic import inside function
- **Solution**: Moved import to module level
- **Evidence**: FastAPI starting successfully

**Issue 4: Missing Test Dependencies** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: `error: Failed to spawn: pytest`
- **Root Cause**: Dev dependencies not properly installed
